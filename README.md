- **AI Chat Integration** — Use `@Excel Agent` in Raycast Chat to build complex models
- **Quick Actions** — One-click formatting for common tasks (Financial Style, Borders, etc.)
- **Robust & Fast** — Optimized specifically for speed and reliability on Mac
- **Multiple AI Providers** — Works with Raycast AI, OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Anthropic Claude

## Requirements

- **Raycast v1.104.3+**

## Setup

### 1. Install the Extension

Install from the Raycast Store or build from source.

### 2. Grant Accessibility Permissions

The first time you run a command, macOS will ask you to grant Raycast Accessibility permissions:

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**
2. Add and enable **Raycast**

### 3. Configure AI Provider

Open the extension preferences and choose your AI provider:

| Provider | Setup Required |
|----------|---------------|
| **Raycast AI** | Raycast Pro subscription |
| **OpenAI** | API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |
| **Google Gemini** | API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com) |
| **Anthropic Claude** | API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |

## Usage

### 1. AI Chat (@Excel Agent)

The most powerful way to use this extension. In Raycast AI Chat, type **@Excel Agent** followed by your request:

- *"Create a DCF model template with assumptions for revenue growth and WACC"*
- *"Analyze this data and format the outliers in red"*
- *"Build a sales table for Q1-Q4 and add a Total column"*

The agent will intelligently break down tasks, write data, format cells, and confirm actions.

### 2. "Ask Excel" Command

Quickly execute single commands or apply presets:

- **Quick Actions** — Instant formatting (Financial Style, Bold Headers, Currency, etc.)
- **Recent Commands** — Your history of custom commands
- **Custom Command** — Type one-off instructions like *"Make A1:E1 bold"*

### 3. "Read Excel" Command

Quickly view the current selection and sheet information without leaving Raycast.

## Tips

- **Be specific** — Instead of "make it bold", try "make row 1 bold"
- **Combine actions** — "Bold headers and add borders to used range"
- **Use Quick Actions** — They're instant and don't require AI
- **Check Excel is running** — The extension will remind you if Excel isn't open

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Excel not running" | Open Microsoft Excel with a workbook |
| "Accessibility permissions" | Add Raycast to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility |
| "No workbook open" | Open or create an Excel file |
| AI not responding | Check your API key in preferences |

## Privacy

- Your Excel data stays on your Mac
- AI providers only receive the minimal context needed (sheet name, selection address)
- No data is stored on external servers by this extension
